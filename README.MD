This is my Hangman README

I have been going over the serialization course work for about a week now. I probably could have done it
faster but it has been really interesting. I am going to be using it now for this project as I have to
create a save state are restore point in my game. I think I will be able to do this one fairly easily as
I don't forsee any special problems, but we'll see. Time to get started.
